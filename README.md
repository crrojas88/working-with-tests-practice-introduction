# Working with Tests

Tests are used by programmers to set up an expectation
to meet for the application they are building. A test
is a way for a programmer to effectively say 'I expect 
this part of my application to function _this way_.' When
the programmer runs the test, they get an answer as to
whether their expectation was correct. If it wasn't, it
means they need to keep working on the code. Tests can
be written _before_ an application is created to help ensure
the app is being designed to spec, or they might be written 
and used while an application is being maintained - to make
sure a new feature doesn't break the app.

In our course materials, we use tests to provide you
with immediate feedback on their code. This way, as you are
learning concepts, you can see quickly if you've written
code that is syntactically correct and achieves the learning 
goals of the lesson you're working on.

Reading and understanding tests is a skill in its own right,
but it isn't always clear what a test is asking for. In this
section are lessons that introduce the basics of testing,
common errors to look out for, and how tests are used in Learn.
